# CNN-CAT-VS-DOGS-V2
# Introduction

This example shows how to do image classification from scratch, starting from JPEG image files on disk, without leveraging pre-trained weights or a pre-made Keras Application model. We demonstrate the workflow on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs binary classification dataset.

We use the image_dataset_from_directory utility to generate the datasets, and we use Keras image preprocessing layers for image standardization and data augmentation.
